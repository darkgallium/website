My name is **Florian Le Minoux** alias darkgallium :)

I'm a french computer science student at INSA Rennes. I'm particularly interested in **networking**, **low-level programming** and **info-sec**.

I'm looking for internship opportunities (in France or abroad) starting in January 2020. Feel free to have a look at my [resume](/cv.pdf).

This website contains mainly some personal [projects](/projects) and a [blog](/posts/).

If you want to contact me : florian+w@aloneinthedark.xyz.
