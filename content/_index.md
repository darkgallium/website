My name is **Florian Le Minoux** alias darkgallium :)

I work as an engineer in cybersecurity. I'm particularly interested in **networking**, **low-level programming** and **cybersec**.

I do contribute from time to time to open-source projects for [deuxfleurs](https://deuxfleurs.fr) or [InsaLan](https://www.insalan.fr).

This website contains mainly some personal [projects](/projects) and a [blog](/posts/).

If you want to contact me : darkgallium+w at deuxfleurs.fr.
