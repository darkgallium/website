## Software

### Current

* raytracer, a tool written in **Rust** and **C** to trace the path of a TCP/IP packet within the Linux kernel's depths. Still at a really early stage.

* [arduino-u2fhid](https://github.com/darkgallium/arduino-u2fhid), an effort to make a U2F FIDO compatible key from an Arduino Micro. Still at a really early stage.

* a [port](https://github.com/darkgallium/openwrt/tree/tl-850re-v2-backport1701) of LEDE 17.01 for my TP Link TL-850re v2 wifi AP (device with a NAND flash of only 4 MB). Not quite working at this time, device boots, failsafe mode works (luckily) but wifi & ethernet don't in normal mode.

### Past

* [langate2000](https://github.com/insalan/langate2000): a captive portal written in **Python** that authenticates users on the network, used at the InsaLan event. I was in charge of the frontend and some backend code.

* [shutter](https://github.com/darkgallium/shutter): a simple screenshot tool written in **C** that aims to cover all of gnome-screenshot's features but as a CLI tool.

* rainbow, a distributed rainbow table implementation written in **C** using the **OpenMPI** library, made as part of an internship at IRISA, supervised by Pr. Gildas Avoine.

## Talks

* 2019: Initial network training (french): some [slides](/formation-reseau-1/) to give a minimal background for the newcomers in the network team at [InsaLan](https://www.insalan.fr).
